      <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
        <p>

      <h1>Functionalities of the system</h1>
      <p>
        As mentioned in introduction the number of cyber-crimes committed has been rapidly increasing because of the increase in availability of computer and network to common man. To prevent the increase of cyber-crimes happening in society we need a deeper understanding about the crimes committed, how they are committed, why they are committed and how it changes over time. All this can be achieved by analyzing a good data set of cyber-crime. 
The main goal of this database is to store data about cyber-crimes in an efficient way so it can be analyzed and provide useful insights to prevent cyber-crimes.
